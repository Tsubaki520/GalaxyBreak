# GalaxyBreak
Galaxy Break is a minimalistic endless video game for mobile published for Android platform. It was developed during my free time as a personal project for Android platform. I used Unity 3D graphics engine and Android native plugins to implement some platform specific features.

The project objective was to develop a nice visuals mobile game with few graphic resources and a minimalistic style. Some of the game highlights are:

– Intuitive simple touch control.

– Progressive difficulty gameplay.

– Up to 5 custom spaceships with own habilities and powers.

– Generic scripts with as many utilities as possible for animation, dynamics, events…

– Very high performance for mobile (shaders, objects pooling, code performance, fake visuals).

– Minimalistic interface using new Unity UI and different types of canvas types (world space, camera based).

Moreover, some Android features I managed are:

– Achievements.

– Leaderboards and events.

– Native sharing access for many applications with results/states delegates.

– Access to locale device information.

– Mobile Advertisement platform (banner/intersticial and rewarded).
